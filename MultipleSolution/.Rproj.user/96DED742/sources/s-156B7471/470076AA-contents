  ## 1. regardless of method, we need to perform the affine transformation which
  ## takes us from x-space (Ax = b) into the alpha-space in which the polytope
  ## described is Ax <= b (denoted below as new_A, new_b)
  ## From there, we could perform the sampling
  
  ## break it up into null space(homogeneous) and particular solution
  
  ## the user enters Ax = b (and we assume they want to intersect the solution
  ## space of that with the simplex) in order for hit-and-run / dikin to sample,
  ## we need a convex polytope. Therefore, we must perform the affine transformation (described in the vignette) which 
  ## brings us from x-space into alpha-space. Specifically, we want to 
  ## 1. represent the solution space in terms of basis 
  ## 2. rewrite it in the generic form of Ax <= b 
  
  ## First, we tag on the simplex equality constraints as an extra row in A.
  ## Next, we know the complete solution is written as v_particular +
  ## homogeneous, where homogeneous is an infinite set parameterized by alpha.
  ## An important note here is that the homogeneous solution returned by
  ## MASS::Null is an orthonormal basis. Since we have this alpha
  ## parametrization, we can write it as v_p + homogeneous %*% alpha >= 0 Then:
  
  ## Homogeneous %*% alpha >= -vp
  ## -Homogeneous %*% alpha <= vp    (Ax <= b form)
